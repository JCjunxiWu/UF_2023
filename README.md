Topic: 

Mobility AI with urban imagery, networks, and natural language

Introduction: 

This topic uses unstructured data for mobility modeling, leveraging the generative and discriminative models of language, imagery, and graphs to develop multi-modal understanding of cities. Here we will be using the unstructured data and methods to understand the two US states, including its demographic makeup, socioeconomic status, and mobility patterns.

Example papers:

1.Using deep learning and Google Street View to estimate the demographic makeup of neighborhoods across the United States

2.Combining satellite imagery and machine learning to predict poverty

3.Deep hybrid models with urban imagery

4.Learning representations of satellite imagery by leveraging point of interests

Resources:

1.Data and coding tutorials are attached in Google Drive.

Task:

focuses on Florida.

1.First, read the example papers and the resources in Google Drive

2.Understand the socio-demographics data from census (California_ct and Florida_ct). Visualize the census tracts using shapefiles (tl_2020_12_tract, Florida; tl_2020_06_tract, California).

3.Download street-view and satellite images. Document the longitude and latitude of the images.

4.Use the street-view and/or satellite images to predict socio-demographics.

5.Design modeling innovations to improve the predictive performance.
